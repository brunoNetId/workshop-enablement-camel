= Lab 4 - Discord Integration

toc::[]

== Overview
Up until now we have evolved a solution to interconnect _Gitter_ and _Slack_, and crucially, with the addition of AMQ Streams, now allows for new systems to easily integrate with the platform. In this new Lab we're going to add a new chat option: _Discord_.

_Discord_ is a well known chat platform, very popular among gamers, but more and more embraced by enterprises for internal communications and to connect with their clients.

The difficulty of this new stage is that we don't have in our _Kamelet Catalog_ connecitivity with _Discord_. We need to create our own connectors.
