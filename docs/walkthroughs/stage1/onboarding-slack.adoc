== Gitter's platform onboarding


=== Join a Slack workspace.

To accelerate the onboarding process in Slack, we've created a public workspace for anyone to freely join and use for the purpose of this enablement workshop. 

Follow the invite link to join the workshop's workspace in Slack:

https://join.slack.com/t/camelworkshop/shared_invite/zt-1fvfhatch-HQKSJyob_YIY3nRGhJ7tWA

CAUTION: The workspace is open to the public, please be mindful of your actions, don't abuse the space.


NOTE: if you were unsuccessful joining the public workspace provided, feel free to create you own Slack workspace, it should be valid and shouldn't create any conflict with this enablement material.

=== Join a Slack room (channel).
. A number of public rooms were made available for this workshop (roomX). Choose a room number that nobody uses to avoid noisy conversations.

Alternatively, you can also create your own room, use the prefix `room_`, for example:

* `room_x`

=== Connecting Camel to Slack

To connect from Camel to the chat platform, you need to register an App in Slack.

If you are running the workshop on your own, you'll have to create an App in Slack. Click the link below to follow instructions on how to create your own App.
