= Lab Introduction

Start from here to familiarise yourself with the goals of this workshop and the scenario it is based on.

Apache Camel has taken a major evolution step with the release of version 3, and now reaches a wider audience with a significant increase of automation level on Kubernetes environments.

=== Workshop's progression

This workshop has been designed to start with the non-_Camel_ user in mind (the _Kubernetes_ user). All the initial data flows are delivered by the Kubernetes user to showcase the no-code building blocks of _Camel_.

Gradually, as the student progresses with the labs, the scenario builds up in a more sophisticated architecture. The presented new use cases per chapter require more and more level of control, an area where the experienced _Camel_ developer is better suited.

Every step you complete in the lab delivers value to the platform under construction. The further you go, the more fascinating power you uncover. It all starts, however, with the simplicity and easiness of no-code building blocks enabling anyone to move data from A to B.

=== User profiles

The workshop has been designed to attend two different user profiles:


* *The Kubernetes user* (no previous Camel experience) +
The way this user consumes _Camel_ is by selecting catalog _Kamelets_ and creating _Kamelet Bindings_ in YAML definitions. The user creates local YAML files and then pushes them to _OpenShift_. The _Camel K_ operator automates the process of building, creating images and deploying the integrations.

* *The Camel developer* +
The traditional _Camel_ developer would typically, first, use his local environment for the inner loop development cycle. This strategy allows speeding up the process of prototyping and validating the code. Once the basics covered, it would follow the same deployment flow as the Kubernetes user.

=== Workshop goals

The list below summarises the main goals the workshop sets for you:

* *Be the Kubernetes user*
+ 
Experience how to define and deploy integration flows with _Camel's_ no-code building blocks: Kamelet Bindings
+
{empty} +

* *Be the Camel developer*
+ 
Experience first hand powerful _Camel_ tooling that accelerates the development process, and how the Camel DSL can help you to implement advanced use cases.
+
{empty} +

* *Extend/Amplify connectivity*
+ 
Learn how both personas (_Kubernetes/Camel_ users) can coordinate to maximise reusability by taking advantage of _Camel's_ open framework.
+
{empty} +


* *Understand different levels of control*
+ 
Familiarise yourself with simple/medium/advanced integrations use cases and how _Camel_ helps you to accelerate in their delivery. 
+
{empty} +

* *Evolve an architecture towards maturity*
+
Understand the justification behind certain design/architecture principles. Experience hands-on how evolving a platform in the right direction gives it a future proof architecture. 
+
{empty} +


* *Play with an exciting collaboration use case*
+ 
Get to know the architecture of a collaboration platform. This is an increasingly needed capability, strategic for any industry/organisation, to connect internally and externally with colleagues and customers.

The above process bridges chat messages from _Gitter_ to _Slack_. It requires enabling access to both chat platforms.

The tasks to complete in this lab will guide you on how to onboard to both chat systems.
