=== Join a Discord server.

To accelerate the onboarding process in _Discord_, we've created a shared server for anyone to freely join and use for the purpose of this enablement workshop. 

Follow the invite link to join the workshop's server in _Discord_:

* https://discord.gg/4PyTjzjJJz

CAUTION: The server is open to the public, please be mindful of your actions, don't abuse the space.

[NOTE]
--
if you were unsuccessful joining the shared server provided, feel free to create you own _Discord_ server, you should be able to complete the workshop in the same manner.

To create your own server, click the `+` (add a server) button, select `Create My Own`, and then `For me and my friends` (private server).

=== Join a Discord room (channel).
. A number of rooms have been made available in the shared server for the workshop (room1, room2, ...roomX). Choose a room number that nobody uses to avoid noisy conversations.
+
Alternatively, you can also create your own room (channel), use the prefix `room_`, for example:

* `room_x`

=== Connecting Camel to Discord

To connect from _Camel_ to the chat platform, an App needs to be registered in _Discord_. You would just need to add the registered App to a particular room to allow _Camel_ to pick up messages.

* If you are running your own workshop you'll have to create an App in _Discord_. Click the link below to follow instructions on how to create your own App.
